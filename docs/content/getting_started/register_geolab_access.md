# Accessing GeoLab

## Access Request Form

Once you have created an [EarthScope User](./register_es_user.md) account, you will need to fill out the [GeoLab Access Request form](https://support.center.earthscope.org/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/31/create/342)

```{note} If you are signed up for one of the EarthScope Short Courses or Workshops that are using GeoLab for the course, this step is NOT necessary and access will be automatically granted.
```

Once the form has been submitted, you will immediately receive an automated response acknowledging receipt of your Access Request form.

At that time, our administrative group will review the form and work to grant you access to GeoLab. This should be completed within 2-3 business days.

We will reach out directly through email if clarification is needed on the intended use case or to double-check the account credentials.

## Login with your EarthScope User account

Once you have been granted access to GeoLab, you can login to the hub either by directly navigating to [this link](https://geolab.earthscope.cloud/hub/spawn) or by accessing our [GeoLab Notebook Hub](https://www.earthscope.org/data/geolab/) webpage and click on the "Launch GeoLab" button.

When the login screen appears, use the same method that you used to register for your EarthScope User account (email & password, OR "Continue with..."). Once your identity has been confirmed, you will be take to the Server Options screen.
