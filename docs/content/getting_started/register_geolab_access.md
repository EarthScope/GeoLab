# Accessing GeoLab

## Access Request Form

If you have an [EarthScope User](./register_es_user.md) account, fill out the [GeoLab Access Request form](https://support.center.earthscope.org/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/31/create/342) to access GeoLab. We will send an email acknowledging receipt of your Access Request to the email used for registration.

```{note} If you attend an EarthScope Short Course or Workshop that uses GeoLab for the course, this step is NOT necessary, and is access granted automatically.
```

EarthScope will review the request to grant you access to GeoLab within 2-3 business days.

EarthScope will contact you via email if clarification is needed on the intended use or review of account credentials.
