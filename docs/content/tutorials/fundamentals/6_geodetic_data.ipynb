    "The recommended method to access EarthScope's geodetic data is to use the [EarthScope SDK](). The SDK supports requesting just the GNSS observations data you need instead of a single RINEX file. It reduces the size of data and returns the data in Apache [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), which is a memory efficient format that can used by analytic data formats such as Pandas [dataframes](https://pandas.pydata.org/). In the future other GNSS data types will be added to the SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/Web_Services_Data_Flow.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Getting RINEX Observations in Apache Arrow from EarthScope\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Arrow is a memory based data format and framework that makes large-scale data analysis faster, more efficient, and compatible across different tools. Arrow is a columnar format, which means that data is held in columns instead of rows. File formats, such as RINEX, are row-based formats. This example compares calculating the average L1 signal strength between a RINEX file and an Arrow response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Row-based format (RINEX)**: \n",
    ">Each observation epoch has: (timestamp, satellite, obs_code, range, phase, snr, slip, flags, fcn, system, igs). To get snr, you would need to read every row and skip the other details, such as phase, slip, system, etc.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Columnar format (Arrow)**: \n",
    ">Data is stored by columns: one column for snr, satellite, phase, etc. Since we're only interested in SNR, you can proceed directly to the SNR column without reviewing the other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature of arrow is that it is a memory format that supports zero-copy sharing. This means that other data formats, such as Pandas, xarray, and numpy, can use Arrow data directly in memory without translation. Analyzing data is faster and more efficient without the overhead of translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important feature of arrow is its vectorized operations, which process many values at the same time. Filtering, aggregating, and joining data are done quickly and in memory. Using the previous example, arrow, can filter snr over a specified period of time and aggregate into 15-minute intervals, reducing the amount of data to transfer and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make arrow an ideal way to deliver large amounts of data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requesting Data in Arrow\n",
    "\n",
    "The EarthScope SDK supports requesting GNSS observations in arrow. An EarthScope client can request RINEX observations in arrow. Because arrow is an in-memory format, it's commonly converted to a Python data structure for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is popular package for working with tabular, or table, data. It enables loading, cleaning, exploring, transforming, and analyzing data efficiently. Arrow tables integrate with other analyis and visualization Python libraries and is commonly used for data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code demonstrates how to use the SDK to request data. As with other methods, an authorization token is needed to make the request. The EarthScope client checks for a token when making a request, which means that it isn't necessary to include it in the request. If you do not have a token, you can use the EarthScope CLI to get a token, see the [**Getting a Token to Access EarthScope Services**](./3_authorization.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client has a `data.gnss_observation` method for requesting GNSS observation data. The method takes a number of parameters but at minimum, the start and end datetime and station is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the request is for 30 hours of data with three hours of data before and after. If we used a web service request, we would have to download two files, extract the data for the time period from each file and join the two files to get the dataset. This method does that automatically and returns only the data you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can convert an arrow table directly into a [dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html), which is a two-dimensional tabular data structure. The `df` displays the first and last five rows of the table."
