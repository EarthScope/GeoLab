    "# Getting a Token to Access EarthScope Services\n",
    "\n",
    "EarthScope currently offers data through web services and, in the future, direct access to seismic and geodetic data in the cloud. In this module, we'll learn how to request an authorization token for downloading or accessing data from EarthScope.\n",

    "## Getting an EarthScope Token\n",
    "\n",
    "EarthScope's funders require tracking data usage. To this end, EarthScope issues a token to access resources. Tokens are tied to your EarthScope account (which you used to log into GeoLab). Tokens are generated using either the EarthScope SDK (Software Development Kit) or CLI (Command Line Interface). Both packages are installed in GeoLab. The simplest way to generate a token is to use the EarthScope CLI. Copy and paste `es login` into a terminal, then follow the instructions to get a token.\n",
