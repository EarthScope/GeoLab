    "# Intro to Git \n",
    "\n",
    "## Keeping track of code\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system (VCS). Software developers use it to track changes to their code over time, enabling collaboration and efficient management of project versions. Think of it as a sophisticated \"undo\" button and a way to manage different versions of files, which is especially useful when multiple people are working on the same project. You can also use git to save your work outside of GeoLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoLab includes the git client. However, to check if git is installed on a computer, use the version flag, which returns the version of git.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a distributed system, meaning you can have a version of code on your computer and access it through a Git service provider. By configuring git with your user name and email, you'll be able to make changes on the remote copy of your code. To configure git in GeoLab, use the following commands in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name anu\n",
    "git config --global user.email anu@gmail.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Git Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Git manages changes to your projects. It uses repositories, which contain all your project files and their complete history. Git keeps track of every modification you make, allowing you to save different versions of your work in a branch and merge changes back into the main project. You can collaborate with others by sharing your project online with a remote repository. You can get feedback through pull requests from other project users and maintainers, and integrate their contributions seamlessly. Git keeps track of changes and lets you collaborate with other project users, making it easier to manage and improve your projects without losing any work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to start using git. The first way is to `clone` or copy a repository from a online git hosting, such as GitLab or GitHub. Cloning a repository copies all the files, code and tracking data, from an online resource to your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is to create a local git repository on your computer. You can create a remote repository in GitHub or GitLab and copy, or `push`, the local repository into the online, or `remote`, repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with cloning a repository, and follow with creating a local repository."

    "## Cloning a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloning repositories enables us to collaborate on projects with other developers. Cloning a repository creates a complete local copy, including all branches and commit history. You can make changes to the project and push your changes back to the remote repository for others to review and merge. To clone the remote repository, use the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone <remote_repository_url>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of repository URLs used when cloning a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTPS URL: Commonly used for cloning and pushing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: https://github.com/username/repository.git\n",

    "## Creating a Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a repository in GeoLab. Open a terminal, and go to your home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ~\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new directory named `my_repo` and then use the `cd` command to switch to it.\n",

    "```\n",
    "mkdir my_repo\n",
    "cd my_repo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new repository, use the `init` command. The repository has a hidden directory, `.git`, which contains the files for tracking and managing changes to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to check if there are changes to repository, use the `status` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the status of all the files in the repository. Since the repository is empty, git will respond with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "\n",
    "No commits yet\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\n",

    "Let's add a Markdown and Python file and add them to the repository.\n",

    "echo \"# My Repository\" > README.md\n",
    "echo \"print(\"Hello GeoLab!\") > hello.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the files are in the directory, git isn't tracking them. When you modify an existing file, create a new file, or delete a file in your working directory, Git considers changes as \"untracked\" or \"modified.\" The `git add` command adds changes from the working directory to the staging area, also known as the index. The staging area acts as a temporary holding area where you can carefully select which changes you want to include when want to save or make a snapshot of the repository. To add all the changes to the staging area, follow the `git add` command with a period, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",

    "2. [Optional] Create a branch for project changes and to preserve the main, or primary branch.\n",

    "5. Save a snapshot of the changes with `git commit`. Committing saves the code at that point and lets you go back to if if needed.\n",
    "6. `git commit` saves the snapshot on your computer. If you want to publish changes to the remote repository on GitHub or GitLab, use the `git push` command.\n",
    "7. Use the `git merge` if you want to update the remote main branch with your changes. If you are working on the main branch, this isn't necessary and a `push` will merge your changes to main.\n",
