    "# Python Environments and Package Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages are collections of modules that provide additional functionality and tools to Python programs. These packages can contain functions, classes, and variables that are designed to perform specific tasks, ranging from data manipulation and scientific computing to web development and machine learning. Developers can leverage pre-written, tested code to save time and reduce the potential for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python package managers are tools for installing, updating, configuring, and removing Python packages. Package managers handle dependencies and ensure that software projects have the necessary libraries and supporting packages to run correctly. They fetch and install packages, simplifying the process of integrating external libraries into projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pip and Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) are popular package manaers. Pip is the default package manager for Python and is commonly used because of its integration with PyPI (Python Package Index), a third-party repository for Python packages. Conda is a package manager that comes with the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/main). Conda can handle packages from various languages and is useful in data science and scientific computing because it can manage non-Python dependencies and complex binary packages. Pip is sufficient for pure Python projects, but conda provides additional functionality and ease of use for more complex environments, making it a preferred choice for many data scientists and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoLab is based on the [PanGeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images) computing environment and uses conda as the package manager. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments are a best practice and an integral part of Python development because they provide isolated environments for project development. Isolation ensures that the dependencies of one project do not conflict with those of another. Developers can manage project-specific dependencies effectively and avoid potential conflicts between package versions. The result is an easy-to-manage, clean, and organized development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To list the virtual environments in GeoLab, type the following command in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment with an asterisk is the current environment. To list the installed packages, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The list has four columns: Name, Version, Build, and Channel. The Channel is the repository for a package. If you scroll through the list, [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) is the predominant channel, and [ PyPI or the Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) is occasionally listed. You can install packages from PyPI in a conda environment, and in general, it will work with the existing dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use or activate a specific environment, for example, `notebook`, use the activate command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To leave an environment, use the `deactivate` command \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an environment with the `conda create` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name <environment name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also clone the base environment if you want to keep the existing packages and install additional packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name myenv --clone notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about creating and managing environments is available in the [documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Don't forget to activate the environment after creating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Python packages with conda, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command installs packages from anaconda.org. If you want to install packages from conda-forge, which has the latest version, add the channel parameter. Either syntax shown below installs a package from a channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install --channel conda-forge <package_name>\n",
    "conda install conda-forge::<package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify package versions, including Python. For example, a package may require Python 3.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install conda-forge:python=3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also install packages with pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoLab instances are ephemeral. That means if you install a package in the terminal, it will not be there the next time you open a stopped GeoLab. The best practice for installing packages is to install them in a notebook with a [magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "%pip install <package_name>\n",
    "%conda install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can create a custom environment or clone the base environment and install the required packages. The custom environment will persist and can be reused. In this example, we will clone the default environment and add a beautifulsoup package for parsing web pages. We can list packages and see beautifulsoup4 and bs4 are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name myenv --clone notebook\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "conda install bs4\n",
    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you leave GeoLab, `myenv` will persist, along with the added packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Python projects use libraries of software, or packages. Building packages with different versions of Python can introduce dependencies on a Python version and other packages as well. Virtual environments manage dependencies by creating a repeatable working space. Conda, the Python package manager, takes this one step further and checks for dependencies and finds, or solves, for packages without dependency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda can install many common packages, however, there are also geoscience packages distributed through the Python Package Index (PyPI). These packages can be installed in a conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the common commands to manage a python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. List the conda environments with `conda env list`.\n",
    "2. Create conda environment with `conda create` environment_name.\n",
    "3. Use the environment you created with `conda activate` environment_name.\n",
    "4. Add conda packages with `conda install` package_name or from the CondaForge repository, `conda install --channel conda-forge` package_name.\n",
    "5. Add packages from PyPI with `pip install` package_name.\n",
    "6. To leave an environment use `conda deactivate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will create an environment and add packages. Follow these instructions and type the commands in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the terminal, change into the geolab directory and create an environment called `first_project`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda create --name first-project --clone base\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. List the environments; you should see `first_project` in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda list\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Activate the geolab-intro environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   conda activate first_project\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. List the packages; it should have the same packages as the base environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda list\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next module, we'll create a Python notebook and explore Python code."
