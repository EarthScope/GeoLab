# Mission
EarthScope Consortium is dedicated to supporting transformative global geophysical research and education.

## Who we are
EarthScope Consortium is a global community of hundreds of employees and thousands of scientists, scholars, and educators. We aim to advance human understanding of the Earth and its physical systems by democratizing access to geophysical observations and practices. In 2023, IRIS and UNAVCO merged to form the EarthScope Consortium, which was established over 35 years ago with similar missions.

EarthScope Consortium continues to operate the [NSF GAGE and SAGE Facilities](https://www.earthscope.org/about/gage-sage-facilities/) previously operated by UNAVCO and IRIS.
