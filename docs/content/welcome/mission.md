# Mission
EarthScope Consortium is dedicated to supporting transformative global geophysical research and education.

## Who we are
EarthScope Consortium is a global community of hundreds of employees and tens of thousands of scientists, scholars, and educators. Our goal is to advance human understanding of the Earth and its physical systems by democratizing access to geophysical observations and practices. In 2023 EarthScope Consortium was formed from the merger of IRIS and UNAVCO, which were both formed over 35 years ago with the largely the same mission.

EarthScope Consortium continues operation of the [NSF GAGE and SAGE Facilities](https://www.earthscope.org/about/gage-sage-facilities/) previously operated by UNAVCO and IRIS.

## Core organizational values
