# Glossary of Cloud Computing Terms

**[bucket](https://cloudian.com/blog/object-storage-care/)**
In this context, the term "bucket" is used to denote any general cloud-based object storage system. A bucket usually has a "policy" that determines who can access the bucket, and what actions you can perform (list, read, copy, etc) on the bucket and its contents. Buckets have many features that make them distinct from file-based / directory storage system.

**[binder](https://mybinder.org)**
A free service for deploying reproducible compute environments.

**[conda](https://docs.conda.io)**
A package and environment management system that can be used for any software language, including Python, R, Java, JavaScript, FORTRAN, etc

**container**

**CPU**

**Dask**

**[Docker](https://www.docker.com)**
Docker is a widely used platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies together into portable, isolated packages called containers.

**[EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html)**
The Amazon Elastic File Storage (EFS) is an AWS service that offers scalable, durable file storage. This is the default storage type associated with everyone's home directory in GeoLab.

**ephemeral**


**[git](https://git-scm.com)**
A widely used version control system used by many open-source projects to manage and share their code base. See [Using Git](../navigate_geolab/using_git.md).

**[GitHub](https://github.com)**
A web-based platform that enables software developers to remotely collaborate on software development using the git command line tool. GitHub is a huge resource for open-source collaboration where users can store, manage, and contribute to not only their own projects, but any public-facing project on the platform. See [Using Git](../navigate_geolab/using_git.md)

**[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)**
Jupyter Book is a command-line tool that allows users to create publication-quality PDFs or web-based interactive books from Markdown documents and Jupyter Notebooks.

**[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)**
A Jupyter Notebook is a human-readable document that allows users to create and share reproducible workflows. The notebook may contain some combination of code (typically Python), equations, images, or narrative text that illustrate the data processing steps that were taken.

**[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io)**
Developed by the open-source Jupyter community, JupyterHub allows you to deploy an application that provides remote data science environments to different users.

**kernel**

**[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)**
The Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is the AWS version of object storage we most commonly use. Usually a more cost-effective option than EFS.
