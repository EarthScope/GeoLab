# Register an EarthScope User account

In order to gain access to GeoLab, you will first need to register for an EarthScope User account.

To start the registration process, click the following link - https://earthscope.org/user

And that should bring you to the screen below ![image](../img/es_login_popup.png)

At the bottom, you can register a new User account by clicking either "Continue with Google" or "Continue with Cilogon". If you do not have a Google account associated with the email that you will use to register, use the "Continue with Cilogon" option.

Either option you choose, it will bring up a page that will have several required fields to fill out: First Name, Last Name, Country, Work Sector, and Institution.

Our list of institutions is populated by the [Research Organization Registry](https://ror.org/) but if your institution if not included, just type the full name and click on the red 'Save...' button in the box. If you are currently unaffiliated with a research or education institution, type "none" in this box and then click "Save".

Finally, click "Register" and that should complete the process. You will then be taken to your User homepage at https://www.earthscope.org/user/info . See the following link for further discussion about what other resources are available from your User homepage.
