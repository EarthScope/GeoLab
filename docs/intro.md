# Welcome to GeoLab!

```{Note}
This [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) is in development as we launch the GeoLab project.
```

GeoLab is a JupyterHub built for the global communities of geophysical researchers, educators, and engineers that are supported by the NSF GAGE/SAGE facilities. In parnership with the International Interactive Computing Collaboration [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/), GeoLab aims to establish an interactive cloud-computing platform to develop community domain knowledge and expertise in open-source and cloud-based projects.

This JupyterBook website is meant to provide basic information about account registration, best practices while using the hub, and some simple tutorials to get you started. All tutorials are Jupyter Notebooks, which can be run interactively, but are also fully completed and rendered on this website for convenience.
