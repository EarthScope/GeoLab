# Welcome to GeoLab by EarthScope Consortium!

```{Note}
This [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) is in development as we launch the GeoLab project.
```

GeoLab is a JupyterHub built for the global communities of geophysical researchers, educators, and engineers that are supported by the NSF GAGE/SAGE facilities. In parnership with the International Interactive Computing Collaboration [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/), GeoLab aims to establish an interactive cloud-computing platform to develop community domain knowledge and expertise in open-source and cloud-based projects.

This JupyterBook is meant to provide basic information about account registration, best practices while using the hub, and some simple tutorials to get you started.
