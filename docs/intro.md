# Welcome to GeoLab!

```{Note}
This [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) is in development as we launch the GeoLab project.
```

GeoLab is a JupyterHub built for the global communities of geophysical researchers, educators, and engineers that are supported by the NSF GAGE/SAGE facilities. In parnership with the International Interactive Computing Collaboration [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/), GeoLab aims to establish an interactive cloud-computing platform to develop community domain knowledge and expertise in open-source and cloud-based projects.

This JupyterBook website is meant to provide basic information about account registration, best practices while using the hub, and some simple tutorials to get you started. All tutorials are Jupyter Notebooks, which can be run interactively, but are also fully completed and rendered on this website for convenience.

Learn more about GeoLab, hosted by EarthScope, by visiting [this link](https://www.earthscope.org/data/geolab/) or by contacting us at: data-help (at) earthscope.org

This text taken from getting_started.md that we probably want to get rid of:
Welcome to GeoLab! The EarthScope-operated JupyterHub that provides a powerful platform for accessing Jupyter Notebooks in a shared, cloud-based environment. GeoLab is a collaborative environment for students, researchers, and other members of the geocentric scientific community to work on high-throughput, data-intensive workflows while having access to powerful computational resources, tools, and a community of experts.

Most of our users will join GeoLab through one of the EarthScope Short Courses or other specific hosted workshops. However, if you have come across GeoLab through some other way and are part of the geophysics or other Earth science communities and want to join GeoLab, please follow the instructions below which will guide you through the onboarding process and gain access to GeoLab.
